In this project, data is scraped from a live website https://news.ycombinator.com/news using BeautifulSoup

The ycombinator website holds a link to tech related news piece or to display anything built by a user.

The main Hackernews page displays the title, link etc of the top 30 articles. But the highest upvoted item is not displayed. So, instead of manually checking the website for the most upvoted article, we pick the said item up using code!

The end product: the title and the most upvoted item in the main page is displayed
