Web scraping provides a solution for those who want to get access to structured web data in an automated fashion. Web scraping is useful if the public website you want to get data from doesnâ€™t have an API, or it does but provides only limited access to the data.
I have used BeautifulSoup Python package and Selenuium to scrape data in different projects found in this Web_Scraping folder
